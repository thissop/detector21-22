# Starting Notes

## Plan
1. Build simple single led arduino circuit  
    * Goal: turn led off and on with Python

2. Build arduino full circuit

## Resources
* [nyc helpful article](https://www.teachengineering.org/activities/view/nyu_probe_activity1): we'll use this to make the actual sensor
* [control arduino with python](https://pythonforundergradengineers.com/python-arduino-LED.html)
* [realpython very helpful](https://realpython.com/arduino-python/): use this for first project 
## General Notes
* Eventually, use wxpython to make window to show information.
